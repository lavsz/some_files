### In the Repo   

**Untitled1** - Using the table generated by the scraper (table-1.csv) to perform some analysis. There are a few functions in here that are defined that will be useful for cleaning many different datasets.

**Souper**- the web scraper that extracts tables

**table-1.csv**- a table generated by Souper 

**Student**- just some documentation of my first round cleaning up the data sets provided in the project repo. There are also a few helpful functions I defined in here as well.

###Ideas
**Basic** - Budget/Revenue/Net Earnings analysis
Comparing the cost of making a movie to how much the movie earns and determining the profit margin. Perhaps we can use genre as a parameter in order to make a recommendations about which movies have the best profit margins.
For example, I used to love this show Borgia, which was like a period drama (on Showtime, I think) and it cost a fortune to recreate all of that historical splendor. So as a result the last season got cancelled, because even though it had a cult following, it didn't draw in a large enough audience to justify the cost. 
On the other hand, sometimes having the right actor or director can cause a low-budget rom-com to make a lot of money. 

**Lavender** - Keyword analysis


**Joe** - Award analysis
One claim that could be investigated is if movies that recieve awards make more money over time, due to their acclaim. It is possible that we could look at movies from the last 5 years and see what kind of earnings they generate over time? There might be more relevant questions too! 

**Christine** - Social Media buzz analysis
Social media can be an inexpensive way and effective way to promote movies. Maybe there is a correlation between social media hype and profits.

**Level-up idea:** Since we already have the webscraper idea locked down, perhaps if we have time we can look into the additional question of whether streaming new movies (like Netflix) is more cost effective than creating theater blockbusters.

**Level-up idea 2** Foreign versus domestic analysis
One thing that has been effecting the movie industry lately is the desire to break into foriegn markets. For example, if an American movie is released in China, the ability to make more money increases because the population is larger -- capturing an audience that makes up on 2% of the Chinese market 288 MILLION people, which is more than 75% of the entire American population (and that is just one country!). So some kind of analysis regarding foreign and domestic profits might be kind of cool. 


###Datasets

https://www.kaggle.com/karrrimba/movie-metadatacsv - I really like this dataset! It has 28 columns of interesting info, including social media info! 

https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset - there are keywords in here too
 
https://datasets.imdbws.com/   - IMBd raw data 

https://www.the-numbers.com - movie data stored in HTML tables for scraping

https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api - another movie database with a free API

http://www.omdbapi.com/ - yet another movie database with a free API

http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/Help/Statistics?file=indexStats.html - might be helpful, but not ideal for scraping or analyzing with python because the stats are stored in PDFs. It might be good to use as a quick read to launch further analysis into a more useful db (unless we want to use OCR but I don't think we have time)

http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ - manually searchable database (results page could probably be scraped)

https://www.wolframalpha.com/ - lots of movie data on here that can be downloaded in plain text

https://www.aggdata.com/awards/oscar slightly outdated, but with a super easy to download CSV

https://data.world/datasets/oscars - Collections of Oscars datasets

https://data.world/promptcloud/youtube-comments-on-oscar-nominated-movie-trailers - Spreadsheet of Youtube comments on Oscars noms

https://lionbridge.ai/datasets/movie-datasets-machine-learning/ - a few datasets from here seem especially helpful!

https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/ - contains tags, which might correspond to keywords

###A few helpful links:

(This might be a way to help us stand out -- creating a database from the IMBD datasets)
