table-1.csv - a table generated by Souper 

Student - just some documentation of my first round cleaning up the data sets provided in the project repo

**A few helpful links:**

https://imdbpy.github.io/ - API interface with code to create IMBD database from dataset.
(This might be a way to help us stand out -- creating a database from the IMBD datasets)

http://www.wandora.org/wandora/wiki/index.php?title=IMDB_extractor - IMDB extractor transforms Internet Movie Database data files into a topic map browsable with Wandora.
(This seems to set up a SQL style db)
